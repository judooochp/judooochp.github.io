          <h2>Royal Quiet De Luxe</h2>
          <h3>23 June 2018 (written 4 August 2018)</h3>
          <p>
            It all began with finding a typewriter &mdash; and really, any old typewriter would have done &mdash; at a thrift store in late June. The Red Racks of Independence, MO had two, actually. I only picked up the one, since it was $36 instead of the $50 for the other. I didn't take a look at the other one and couldn't be bothered to, since it seemed so much less antique or authentic. Considering what I know now, I certainly would given the chance again.
            <br /><br />
            I've come across several typewriters during thrift shop outings, and I've always been able to recognize them by their asymmetrical cases, but nothing took hold of me quite like this Royal. Hell, before that day it never had crossed my mind that there would be more than a couple manufacturers. The typewriters I had seen were always dusty, gross pieces of metal with broken plastic that had either spiders or their carcasses littering the insides. The keys would stick and I would think, "Hmph, this must be junk."
            <br /><br />
            I was looking through the electronics section. I wasn't looking for anything in particular. It's just a section I visit whenever I go thrifting, looking for whatever someone thought was junk that might be worth a few dollars more on the internet. Maybe I'd find some old Kustom guitar amplifier or RCA radio or turntable, who knows?
            <br /><br />
            I saw the case, rusted latch with its single button throw, next to printers and sewing machines. Whatever it was, it probably had cobwebs all through it. I popped it open and saw the keys, thinking they looked quite a bit older than the plastic kind I'd seen on the '90s model electronic ones. It was black, or used to be. The air quickly smelled like the light film of decades of smoke and some lighter dust from even more decades of sitting in someone's basement. I picked up the case and set it on an empty part of the shelves to tap away and noticed immediately how much more force it required than our modern keyboards.
            <br /><br />
            I would later find that it required more finesse than strength to run this beauty. Before that though, I found the shells of dead spiders and figured I'd grab some compressed air to blow it out. The insides seemed a lot less dense than I'd remembered from playing with some old machine we'd had while I was a kid.
            <br /><br />
            I didn't even notice that the thing was missing its ribbon, and it didn't take long for me to realize that something was wrong after I noticed that striking the keys quite hard &mdash; like a n00b would &mdash; punched holes through the paper for o's, e's, a's and the like.
            <br /><br />
            Searching on the internet for some new ribbon opened a fuckin' rabbit hole of discovery into some strange subculture I didn't even know existed. Yeah, you could get some ribbon, but what about restoration? Cleaning? God damned <em>daily maintenance!?</em> I might not be able to find a daily or even monthly use for this thing, but I started with something I could actually get done.
            <br /><br />
            I brought out my CLP (gun oil), cotton swabs, paper towels and window cleaner, and my wife was no longer happy about how the day was going. I found a video about how to align the typebars, how to align CAPS and lower-case, how to oil and where, and I was off to the races.
            <br /><br />
            I found an old video about how to even use the thing effectively. Oh, the finesse! This lady's fingers skip along! I don't even know <em>what</em> to write, but I was immediately hooked on toying with the machine's insides to make it possible for this hunk of metal, rubber, and paint to perform for clumsy old me even remotely as well as that machine worked for her!
            <br /><br />
            So I've caught the bug. After I returned from our July 4th vacation, my replacement ribbon had arrived. A few more adjustments and several pages of alignment tests, speed tests, and nonsense later, I wanted more.
