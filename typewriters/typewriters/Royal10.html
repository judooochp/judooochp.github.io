            This guy was found at the Gladstone, MO Redracks for $100. I kinda feel guilty about this one, 'cause it's so ugly. The thing's platen is fucked, and it makes a lot of noises that it really shouldn't be making. Many of the typebars stuck, and the thing reeked.
            <br /><br />
            I had actually walked away from it because I thought the price said "999.00", but after having some kind of a memory while I was leaving the Salvation Army across town, I called Redracks to check. "Was that typewriter a thousand? Or ninety-nine-ninety?"
            <br /><br />
            So I went the fuck back and got it. (God damn it.)
            <br /><br />
            The dust and smoke grime on the beast was palpable. The keys had probably never been cleaned, as there was black awful around the centers. The carriage return lever didn't feed a line until it hit the full starting position. Sometimes it doesn't even reach the starting column, and the tab key engages the shipping bar. Weird. That's probably a spring thing. I don't think I can fix that one.
            <br /><br />
            After taking some pictures, I started cleaning. I haven't got to the striking heads yet. There's so much ink gunk built up that I can't even. I'll have to get a toothbrush with some turpentine or gasoline.
            <br /><br />
            The sticky keys were (as far as I know) misaligned heads, but at the moment they're all better. Some oil in the levers, compressed air everywhere, and wiped the hell out of the shell. You can see the before and after in the gallery. I went through probably fifteen half-sheets of paper towels with window cleaner to get it that way, and it's still letting go of orange and brown smoke residue.
            <br /><br />
            The mysteries never seem to end, and I've just got started!
