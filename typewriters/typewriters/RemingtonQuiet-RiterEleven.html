          <h2>Remington Quiet-Riter Eleven</h2>
          <h3>3 August 2018 (written 4 August 2018)</h3>
          <p>
            I told my wife I would spend my Friday off looking for a new job. And I did that, for a few minutes. I was even awake on time and got my son to his daycare more or less on time in an effort to get online to check out the job boards for the third time this week.
            <br /><br />
            Well, I got bored. I started to look into my now-working Royal. I was quite pleased with how it turned out, as imperfect as it was, and I found that some of them were going for two or three hundred. Cleaning it up was some good fun, and with even just a hundred I'd stand to make fifty bucks.
            <br /><br />
            So I went out to thrift me some typewriters that maybe I'd <em>want</em> to sell. I'd come home with two, but I'll just go through the first one here.
            <br /><br />
            I was amazed to find it at the first of many thrift stores I'd planned to visit: the Liberty, MO Savers. The Remington Quiet-Riter Eleven was $15 &mdash; a fuckin' steal, I thought. The baby blue popped at me, and it even had some carbon paper in the tough-looking case that I went ahead and tested it on.
            <br /><br />
            There were a few problems with it, and more if some internet rumors are proven true. The margins didn't stop the carriage during a return, the bell was very faint, and it was dirty with something a lot like sawdust but finer. Weird.
            <br /><br />
            Oh well, it's cheap. And with some issues to correct, I can learn a shit ton. I loaded it up and checked out, and while my card was being run, I noticed another machine's case on display up front that I totally missed. It was a Sears electric of some kind, but I wasn't interested.
            <br /><br />
            After getting the thing home, I realized that these weren't sawdusts, but <em>erasures</em> that were never cleaned up. After some inspection, I found that the margin release connecting rod was bent. I was a bit nervous about unbending it with force, but a pair of pliers did the trick.
            <br /><br />
            The bell ding was fun (not). I found that the spring was just loose enough to not keep tension, so with considerable effort and care, I took the spring out, cut the last two coils, and bent in a new hook. Replacing that thing was a pain in my ass, since I left all my good tools at work, but it got done.
            <br /><br />
            There are still problems with it, but that leaves plenty of opportunity to figure out what the hell I'm doing! In the mean time, I got distracted with the second find of the day: The Royal 10.
