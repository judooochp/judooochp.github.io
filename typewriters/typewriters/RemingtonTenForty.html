            So I stopped by The Arc on North Oak. It's a usual stop, though it tends to house a very limited selection of anything that isn't 60+ year women's clothing. Sometimes I've found some nice pocket knives or lamps, too. Of course, the day's mission was another typewriter.
            <br /><br />
            They didn't have one in the foyer, but that room was filled with workout benches and golf clubs, tools and the like. I was the first person there and was greeted warmly, as I usually am while visiting them.
            <br /><br />
            After a look-see around the rest of the store, I asked the ladies at the front, still setting up the day's work, if they do get typewriters or if they'd seen one I'd missed. One of the ladies, white-haired with a thin, strong frame and a British accent, told me that they usually don't keep them because they never sell. Thinking about it now, if only older people visit this store, they probably weren't in there for typewriters.
            <br /><br />
            She told me that she had one that was hers that she had just taken to the other store she worked at up in Smithville. I suppose she lives up there, too. She took my number so when she was up there on Saturday (the next day,) she'd be able to tell me if it was still there. I thanked her very much and hoped that I'd be able to make it up <em>some</em> time.
            <br /><br />
            &nbsp;
            <br /><br />
            On the way out to do some shotgun shooting with my buddy &mdash; unnamed to protect the innocent &mdash; this lady gave me a ring to tell me she still had it. After finding out that the ammunition I'd bought was so cheap it was the cause of the jamming weapon, we hit up the short range for some .22 shooting, then headed out to Smithville to check up on the machine.
            <br /><br />
            I did manage to, characteristically, get a bit lost due to trusting the roads a bit much. At least one can do that these days without fear of getting murdered... as much. When we did get into town, we stopped by the screen printers across the street before hitting up The Arc, and we discovered that a run of 60 items was far less expensive than expected.
            <br /><br />
            I looked around the thrift shop a bit, just in case the typewriter was still on a shelf, but the old lady saw me and brought it out forthwith. I thanked her and got to tesing alignment and such. The paper in the case was probably also from the Seventies. It was magnificent. I suppose that's what a typewriter should act like &mdash; oh, wait, that key's a bit sticky. Nothing a little oil can't help. But otherwise, in relatively pristine order. I didn't even notice until my wife pointed it out later that, uhm, this is a British typewriter. Check out that &pound; (5)!
            <br /><br />
            "You really only want $15? ... I'll definitely take it!"
            <br /><br />
            If you're up in Smithville, MO, stop by <a href="https://www.thearc.org/">The Arc</a> thrift store and say "Hi" to Evelyn <!-- Evelyn Blanks -->and the crew. They have some wonderful things for sale, and their mission is to assist those with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
