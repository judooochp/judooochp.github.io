            <h2>the moody method</h2>
            <p>
                The "Union Jack," or Moody Method is a procedure to take predefined points on a surface plate, step from one to another with precise foot spacing, and calculate elevation of the points relative to each other.
                <br /><br />

                By first taking measurements along the diagonals, we can establish the points at the ends relative to the very center, provided we control for an even and identical number of measurements along each line. Because most equipment uses a four-inch footspacing, the exact step size may have to be a bit longer or a bit shorter than four inches. This is accomodable by the mirror's foot size, usually about half an inch in diameter, so that any one step may be a quarter inch short or long.
                <br /><br />
                The Moody Method provides mathematical means to transform the angle measurements taken from an autocollimator at each step, relative to the first measurement of each line, into relative elevations at each foot placement.
                <br /><br />
                Lines 1 and 2 set up our reference planes and our relative "zero" in the center of the plate. Lines 3 thru 6 are taken starting on and ending on the known points from the ends of lines 1 and 2. Because all lines have even measurements, the middle "stations" of these perimeter lines are used as fixed points for lines 7 and 8. Finally, the middle stations of 7 and 8 are used to check "closure error." <br /><br />
                Closure error gives us a measure of the reliability of the entire process. A closure error in excess of 10% of the flatness measured (although 40 &micro;in closure error is acceptable for any size and grade of plate) is considered too much, and the plate must be measured again. An experienced technician may be able to determine if a particular line is the culprit and redo just that one line.
                <br /><br />
                In my personal experience, autocollimators tend to prefer constant temperatures, and any whack closure errors have tended to be caused by my touching the device only so recently. So, I usually redo line 1, and that usually fixes the issue.
