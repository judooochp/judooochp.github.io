<p>Everything barely works. I guess that's all it has to do.</p>
<p>There is a crappy database, with some crappy placeholder data so I can learn this crap from the ground up.</p>
<p>The website will load a few pages: Manage Companies, Manage Addresses, Manage Contacts, and Update of each as well. These are basically the grid view of all companies, addresses, contacts, and the single-record view/update screen when one of the grid-view records is chosen. In the future, there will be some login and view/permissions control. For now, it's rather bare.</p>
<p>In fact, it's likely to not work at all until I get the permissions system working. Tera doesn't have a template comment system that's quite like Django, so I haven't figured out how to save that without messing it all up.</p>
