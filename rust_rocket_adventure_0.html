<p>This is more or less a logging of my new project for management of calibration laboratories through a web application. I'll be using Rocket, and otherwise starting from the ground up. As this is "Session Zero", I can only report that I've played with Rust, Rocket, Postgres, Tera, etc., enough that I have determined that this is a feasible project, and the planning that I've done so far is probably a hundredth of what I'll end up needing to do. This specific logging of the adventure should take the reader from nothing up through deploying an app that stores, displays, and manages contacts, and which logs an audit trail of those interactions.</p>
<p>I have had some difficulty getting going myself, and I hope that other people find this helpful. I don't really intend it to be step-by-step, but difficulties in figuring out things (even if only in my own slow brain) will be laid out.</p>
